# Generating SSH Keys for GitHub
This README provides a guide on how to generate SSH keys for secure access to GitHub.

**What are SSH Keys?**

SSH stands for Secure Shell.

SSH keys are a crucial part of the SSH protocol, enabling secure and passwordless authentication for remote access to computers.
SSH keys are cryptographic key pairs used for secure authentication. They consist of:

* **Public Key:** This key is shared publicly and added to your GitHub account.
* **Private Key:** This key is kept secret and stored on your local machine.

SSH keys provide a more secure alternative to password-based authentication by eliminating the need to transmit your password over the network.


# SSH keys are essential for interacting with GitHub for several key reasons:

1. Enhanced Security:
2. Streamlined Workflow:
3.  Advanced Features:
